                <p >
                  The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna 
                  in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan 
                  to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
                   The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, 
                   and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

               <h1> Nahargarh Fort</h1>
               <p>
                  Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in 
                  the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed 
                  a strong defence ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became 
                  known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands
                  for Nahar Singh Bhomia,whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort.

               <p>
                  The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, 
                  that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan 
                  commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital 
                  from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad 
                  Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture
                   under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
